# Design O' Souls - UML Class Diagram Analysis and Design

## Project Overview

Design O' Souls is a project focused on analyzing and designing UML Class Diagrams for a game simulation based on the popular game "Dark Souls." This project involves implementing various design principles and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts to create a comprehensive and scalable game design.

## Design Principles and Patterns

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Applied principles like polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **Design Principles:** Adhered to SOLID principles, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Single Responsibility Principle, and Reduce Dependency Principle.
- **Design Patterns:** Used UML diagrams (Class, Sequence) to visualize and document the system architecture.
